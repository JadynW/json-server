      "description": "Among coffee-producing countries, Ethiopia holds near-legendary status not only because it’s regarded as the \"birthplace\" of Arabica coffee, but also because it is simply unlike every other place in the coffee world. Unlike the vast majority of coffee-growing countries, the plant was not introduced as a cash crop through colonization. Instead, growing, processing, and drinking coffee is part of the everyday way of life, and has been for centuries, since the trees were discovered growing wild in forests and eventually cultivated for household use and commercial sale."

      "description": "Ethiopia’s Sidamo Zone is a famous coffee-producing area. Sidamo’s high elevation and cool climate create ideal growing conditions, and the area’s coffee is sought after for its intensely fruit-forward and floral qualities. Coffee has been growing here for centuries, and it’s an important source of income for rural households. Most producers in Sidamo farm organically on small plots of land, averaging 2-5 hectares in size. This coffee comes from the Aroresa washing station, to which around 700 producers deliver their ripe cherries. The station’s employees process coffees using both the natural and washed methods. This lot was meticulously wash-processed, which means the fruit and skin were removed from the beans before they were graded and soaked in clean water. After that, the coffee was re-washed, re-graded and soaked again, before being laid out to dry on raised beds."

The daily rate at the time of purchase was 950,000 pesos per cargo (125kg of parchment coffee) for this lot UBACAFE was paid 1,200,000 pesos per carga."

His farms, including ‘Las Plantas’ are currently under the administration and operation of the second and third generation of the Herrera family, with collectively has over 50 years of experience in growing coffee. The family has been pushing the quality of the coffee processing allowing their plants to bring forth their best qualities. Through our green bean partner Project Origin, we work closely with Otto, the Herrera family through our local partners in Guatemala, who focus on growing and exporting different lots and varietal separations that are always juicy, complex, and downright delicious. This washed bourbon/caturra lot has a distinct chocolate sweetness, accompanied by a mandarin note and lingering citrus acidity."

      "author": "Adrian Dart",
      "p1": "A world of information to sort through, choices galore, and not everyone is able to guide you through choosing the right coffee you are looking for. Today we will walk you through some key factors to take into consideration when you are next making that important choice for yourself or a loved one. Whether that’s purchasing some delicious beans or staring at a coffee menu, get ready to make the most important decision of the day.",
      "h1": "Roast Freshness",
      "p2": "Fresh is best. I only drink the best. One of the great all time myths about coffee is that it keeps forever. The opposing myth that coffee goes ‘bad’ and can’t be used after 2 weeks is also somewhat misleading.  So what is the deal? There really is only one choice here. Coffee is a fruit, a cherry in fact, and it’s a carefully grown processed agricultural product. So fresh is always best. So how are we going to know what fresh looks like? Look for beans that have a clear printed roast date on them. Any coffee that can’t tell you this information, probably doesn’t want to. Buy it as freshly roasted as possible and look to use it all up no later than three weeks after the printed roast date for maximum enjoyment. The ideal ‘peak’ flavour times are usually found between day 7 and 14, which will be the norm for most of the great cafes you visit. You can still potentially look to use beans for up to 4 weeks, but most of the time, after day 14 the quality and flavour intensity will start to fade and leave you with some very flat cups and sad faces.",
      "h2": "Origin Selection",
      "p3": "Growing conditions and economic factors vary greatly across the planet and so it’s no surprise that coffee grown in one country will be different from the next. Wine drinkers have a long-held appreciation for this phenomena, having come to expect to see specific flavour and aroma characteristics from a French wine that may be clearly distinctive from an Italian or something grown in Australia. Coffee prefers to grow in the warmer latitudes between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. This band of latitudes is often referred to as the ‘coffee belt’. Within this band a vast array of variables exist including altitude, rainfall, soil conditions and sunlight, all of which will alter the outcome of how your coffee will taste. Do I even need to look elsewhere?  Perhaps if you prefer a coffee to be heavier bodied and earth in character, selecting from the India and Indonesian region is for you. Often exhibiting a luscious syrupy body combined with herbal and savoury flavours, these tend to be the most dividing in personal preference and definitely sit in the ‘Love or Hate’ bracket.",

      "author": "Blue Bottle Coffee",
      "p1": "From handmade cards to a year’s worth of coffee, gifts are small yet tangible ways to express recognition. At its best, gift-giving says, I see you—for the work you do, the sacrifices you make, and the generosity you practice.  Recognition is especially valuable when it goes to people who don’t receive the acknowledgment they deserve. If we had it our way, we would honor the women who drive the coffee industry (many of whom are mothers) every day of the year.",

An outlier in Brazil, where factory farming continues to be the norm, FAF now produces truly exceptional organic coffees, and Barretto wants to turn this practice into a family tradition by someday passing the torch to her son, Felipe.",
      "h2": "ANA LETIS REYES, HONDURAS",
      "p3": "Though Letis Reyes is still a relatively new producer in Honduras’ Santa Bárbara Department, Blue Bottle has been purchasing her remarkable coffees since her first harvest in 2015.   Through her dedication to quality, Letis Reyes is putting her remote town of San Jose Los Andes on the map. But she’s also giving back to her own community: On her little corner of Santa Bárbara Mountain, there is little income to be made outside of coffee, which means that long-distance transit is a fact of life for many local workers. A mother herself, Letis Reyes also cares for a group of children whose parents must travel in order to support their families.   As our green coffee buyer, Charlie Habegger, says, she’s \"many times a mother.\" ",
      "p4": "When our guests buy our coffees, they’re supporting these incredible women as well as the coffee shop, and we couldn’t be more grateful.",
